accounts here will be stored in `.json` files<br>
they're also protected by the `.gitignore` file and loose encryption though I'd suggest not giving them out<br>
when you sign into an account it automatically makes an account file for it<br>
you can change if it should add an account to this folder in the `config.json` file
